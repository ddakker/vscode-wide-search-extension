# Wide Search

Full-width **Find in Files** for Visual Studio Code.

[한국어](README_ko.md)

## Why?

VSCode's built-in search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) opens in the sidebar with a narrow preview. A wide, editor-tab-based search panel feels so much better.

**Wide Search** replaces the default search with a full-width editor tab:
- Flat result list with highlighted matches
- Editable preview — fix code right in the search panel
- Instant search as you type

## Features

- **Instant search** — results stream in as you type, powered by ripgrep
- **Replace** — single match or replace all across files, saves immediately
- **Editable preview** — click a result, edit directly, auto-saves after 1 second
- **Flat result list** — every match on its own line with filename and line number
- **Regex replace** — supports `\n`, `\t` escape sequences and `$1` capture groups
- **Multiline search & replace** — `M` button or paste multiline text to auto-activate
- **Folder scope** — right-click a folder in Explorer to search within it only
- **Auto-save before search** — unsaved files are automatically saved so ripgrep can find them
- **Search history** — up to 50 queries, navigate with arrow keys
- **Filters** — file mask (e.g. `*.ts, *.java`), case sensitive, regex
- **Keyboard-driven** — full navigation without the mouse
- **Theme sync** — respects your VSCode color theme
- **i18n** — English and Korean, auto-detected from VSCode language setting
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux, macOS
